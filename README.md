DRV2605 Haptic Motor Driver (0x5A)

November 6, 2018 - Today's task is the PCB soldering milestone. The gerber files I sent to the prototype lab did not receive the email, I had to send another email to the lab. I confirmed that they received the email now I am waiting to wait for the lab to make my PCB. I got the pin sockets for my raspberry pi and motor today. I pulled out some pins from the socket as the pins won't be used for my circuit.
